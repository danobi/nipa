-rc2 or -rc3 time frame for things that never worked in the first place.
If something never worked, then the fact that it doesn't work now is not
a regression, so the fixes should just wait for the next merge window.
Those fixes are, after all, essentially development work."

"NONE of this seems really to be appropriate for this stage. It doesn't
fix regressions, it doesn't fix security stuff, it doesn't really fix
major oopses."

regression or security issue. Other stuff can wait until the merge
window and perhaps be marked for stable if required. That way they'll
get testing."
